    "I'm working to learn more about how I can use large language models (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve existing process and work-pipelines by offloading repetitive tasks. A part of expanding my knowledge around LLMs and RAG includes being able to generate a body of knowledge that is specific to the process or work-pipeline that I'm targeting at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help me focus on getting to a RAG and not be swallowed by the vast amount of information on the topic or the other options like knowledge graphs, I've decided to begin my exploration using [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/docs/overview/introduction) (Chroma). Chroma is an open-source (Apache 2.0) vector database that, from what I can tell, provides a simple Python SDK and CLI that I can use to build out my knowledge base."
